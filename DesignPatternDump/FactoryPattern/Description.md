Factory Pattern

- The Factory Method Pattern defines 
- an interface for creating an object, 
- but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
- Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.


- Basically the SubClass decides what concrete object to create
- Only subclasses implement the "Factory Method" (Method used to Create stuff)
- Also the instantiation is separted from the normal code
- Also we are using interfaces and shet so we are cool now
